### Compatibility with ModelEngine assets
To reduce your learning time and use BetterModel effortlessly, I'm currently making this plugin based on [ModelEngine's wiki](https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/model-engine-4/-/wikis/home).  
Since there are many features shared with MEG, I strongly suggest you to refer both of BM and MEG wiki.

### A strength compared with MEG
- Open source
- Free license based on [MIT](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
- More accurate position sync (like body rotation and mount)
- More vanilla-like physics (like collision with entity, shadow, fire, jump, idle-walk animation shifting)
- More practical and optimized API (like spawn handling per each player)
- Improved version compatibility
- Very lightweight source code
- Folia support
